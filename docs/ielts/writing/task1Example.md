In 1980, the park was much greener area with a large number of trees and flowers scattering throughout the northern and southern areas respectively, but during the next 30 years it experienced dramatic changes. The most noticeable change is that the park has been divided into four sections. Some trees are still located in the northwest part of the park, but others existing in the northeast part are cut down to make way for an area of barbecue. Meanwhile, a few tables have been added in this small place as well.  

 In the southwest and southeast of the park, the flowers have been completely replaced by bushes and a play area for children separately. But in the same location, the benches are kept, which still surround the small pond. Finally, the west gate was demolished and the south exit remains. 

Overall, the main changes made to the park are service facilities which are available for local residents in current times.

范文：
In 1980, the two doors to the west and south connected a curved road, dividing the entire park into two parts.
Among them, the southwest part accounted for about a quarter of the entire garden area, mainly composed of a pond surrounded by some benches to the north and flowers to the south. The remaining part accounts for three-quarters of the garden with a large area of forest to the north and some flowers to the southeast.
Now, as a result of the transformation of the original curved road into an intersection structure of the entire park has undergone significant changes, transforming from two parts of vastly different sizes to four equal parts. There have also been some changes in the distribution of vegetation, including the flowers in the southern part of the pond becoming bushes, the addition of a house and some benches in the north for barbecue, and the flowers in the south now becoming a place for children to play football.
However, the forests in the north, the ponds and benches in the southwest direction and the south gate have been preserved.

The two maps depict the changes of a particular city. One of them is from 1965 and the other displays the present-day layout, combined with some potential designs for 2018. There have been some changes in the last half century relating to the architecture, facilities and natural resource. 

Regarding the environment, there are fewer trees located in the northwest part of the city compared to the past because a car park is built in this part. A foot bridge is added to the river which did not exist in 1965. In terms of building, a few houses were built in the northeast part of the city in 1965, while they have now been transformed into many large buildings. As for future, plans, there will be two proposed parking lots, one of them being approximately three times larger than the other one. The first one will be located in the southeast of the river, whereas the second one will be situated within the residential community. 

It is abundantly clear to see that great changes have taken place in the aforementioned city over the past half century.

The flow chart depicts the detailed process by which the canned fruit is manufactured, starting from the picking of fruits to the completed goods sold in supermarkets. 

Firstly, fruits must be picked from trees and then transported to factories. Afterwards, they are carefully sorted, the bad ones are rejected and the suitable ones are weighed. Subsequently the qualified fruits that are marked with clear weight are washed and cleaned before being stored in refrigerators. After a certain period of time, the refrigerated fruits will be taken out, peeled, and cut into small pieces. 

In the next step, the flesh is bottled and mixed with water, juice or syrup and the mixture are sealed to ensure there is no leakage. Then, the products must be cooked or sterilised and cooled. After that, they are packed into boxes or other containers and shipped to the supermarkets where they are bought by customers. 

The process of making canned fruit consists of numerous steps, all of which lead to the finished product.

The flow chart presents  various effects of deforestation that culminate in many negative consequences, including flooding and biodiversity decline. As is shown in the illustration, the main outcomes of clear-cutting of forests are divided into four categories. 

Firstly, the soil being compressed by heavy logging equipment, becomes hard and baked, which provides a flat surface for rainwater to run off, thus leading to devastating floods. Secondly, after a forest is cut down, there are fewer roots holding the top soil in place, this causes soil erosion. 

Thirdly, clear-cutting of forest make the risk of deliberate or accidental burning increase. When the waste wood from logging is destroyed, the number of micro-organisms that feed on the waste will reduce. Meanwhile, pioneer species move in and vegetation is degraded. The whole process eventually gives rise to a great loss of biodiversity. Finally, due to deforestation, plants release less moisture into the air, which is one of the major contributors to less precipitation, and then aridity frequently occurs. 

Overall, it could be observed that soil erosion, vegetation degradation and increased drought are major causes of biodiversity loss.
