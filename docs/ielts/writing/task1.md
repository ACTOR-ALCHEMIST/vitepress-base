The first map depicts a small park in 1980. Looking at the details, the a arch shaped road connected with two gates, west gate and south gate. At the same time, there is a small pond located in the south west corner, which was arrounded by a small number of flowers and benches. By contrast, the south west of the park is a flower ocean. And the remaining part of the park is distributed numerous trees.

In contrast, currently, the pond and the jungle in the south part remain unchanged, whereas, the west gate is removed. Also, all flowers in this park is vanished and the flower sea have been transformed into a sports field. Obviously, the band road has been expanded into a crossroad, which connect south, east, west, and north direction of the park. Specifically, in the north east corner, some table and a barbecue campsite have been built.
