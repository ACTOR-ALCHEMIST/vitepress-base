1. 开头
2. Admittedly, there is no doubt that the newest studying form of online is a good motivator to help some remote students who can accept modern education properly. It is true that the internet is a solid bridge between the best teachers living in the metropolis and students living in the remote bridges. This might be true to some extent. However, the claim could not hold water, which is on account of the fact that there are still a small number of poverty-stricken regions which are not covered by internet; thus, those people living in there have no idea to got the newest education through the internet.
3. It is necessary to emphasize an important point that compare with latest form of learning, the traditional face-to-face teaching method has numerous irreplaceable advantages. Primily, the form of online teaching can only provides video and voice streams to each other, whereas classic teaching ways can beyond that such as physical instruction and figure demonstrating. Secondarily, students studying from home are easier to be affected by environments. For example, there are a large number of families that have a pet, like cat or dog.

2. Surely, there is an assumption that the government raise the cost of fossil fuels could reduce the use of vehicles to cease the traffic jam. What they might believe is that if some use of car is less important to someone, they will tend to choose public transportation or just by walk due to the increasing amount of oil fee. This point seems to be plausible, whereas the claim could not hold water, which is on account of that a large number of vehicles are not driven by traditional fossill fuels because recently, the share of electric cars are gradually taking over this of fuel vehicles.
3. It is necessary to emphasize an important point that riseing the cost of gasoline could not only have a weak impact on traffic jam, but also have a damaging effect on our societies. **Primily**, for some people living in remote places that lack public transportation, they may experience finicial difficulties from time to time caused by a higher oil fee. **Secondarily**, due to the increasing development of electric cars, the growing oil price is likely to make some people choosing a new energy vehicle rather than triditional car, which have no idea to reduce the number of vehicles on the road, just changing the form of power source of vehicles.











It is necessary to emphasize an important point that the form of education that oriented to the career is beneficial for student's future development and university's fame. **Primarily**, there are increasing number of demands on the job market.

### what are the advantages and disadvantages of study abroad？

The debate regarding the topic of whether we should studying abroad is controversial. It is argued by some people that there are a large number of advantages if students study abroad. However, others hold the view that the domestic education system is good enough so that people are not necessarily to go abroad for a degree.

Actually, there have already been many shining examples that testify to the upwards of people studying abroad. **Primarily**, for some students living in a small language country going abroad to atudy is a good way to forge their language skills, bacause they must overcome numerous difficulties, such as writting a foreign language essay, talking with foreigner partners, and listening miscellaneous courses. **Secondarily**, there are a wide range of customs throughout the world. Studying abroad is beneficial for one's cultural adaptability. This is because changing a living place, is inevitable that facing on various cultures. For instance, European are not likely to use umbrellas when it rain. So, facing such miscellaneous cultures may be a good way to cultivate one's multicultural mind.

It is also necessary to emphasize another important point that studying abroad may still have a small number of adverse aspects. **To begin with**, in some developing countries, there are a large proportion of poverty-stricken people and they usually are the sole breadwinner of a family, so in this condition, sending their children to study abroad may have a damaging effect on their daily life experiences. **Another important fact is that** some students who are short of independent abilities may hardly to live in a brand new environment. For instance, their naivé could make them more likely to become the target of blackmail, scams, and other fauldulent people, so staying at home may be better for them.

To sum up, it is beyond dispute that studying abroad will be the bandwagon in the visible future. On the one hand, it will be a good chorice for a few conditional students, on the other hand, this form of studying may not suit for everyone.

### the rate of juvenile delinquency is rising rapidly. Give possible reasons and solutions. 

In the past, the almost young generations were likely to remained humble and polite, because the information they received is simple and repetitive . Recently, the rate of teenager criminals are increasing rapidly. It iis necessary that we ascertain the causes of this disturbing issue and explore effective solutions to handle it.

In terms of the individual aspect, the explosion of information and the spiraling internet are the root cause. As is know to all, there are a great deal of pron and aggrisive perform on the internet, which is easy to be observed by teenagers. These misleading informations are likely to mislead them to do the wrong things, such as bribe, induce and blackmail. When it comes to the family side, the neglect of supervision is another major factor. This is related to the fact that with the increasing amount of workload in the workplace, some people work under enourmout stress, therefore they back home and impose more rigid control over their children. This is more likely to increase rebellious psychology of the childs.

Considering the seriousness of this disturbing issue, effective solutions should be addressed to handle it. The most importantly, governors and instructors should put much emphasis on the regulation of the internet. For example, they can supervision some illigel informations, and ban the ip address of porn or fraudulent websites. To relieve such situation related to family, It is a good way that the babor bureau can establish some policies that can relieve some stress of employees, such as increase legal holidaies, canceling the nine-to-five work daily routine and to loosen the timetable for some parental work forces.

In conclusion, the cause of juvenile criminals are various and it requires multi-faceted approaches such as the society, the governments and the entrepreneurs to solve such modern scourge.

It is widely accepted that giving priority to major competitions is a good way to increase the soft power of a country. Some people argue that putting more emphasize on the large-scare competitions may be better, whereas others hold the view that governments should attach more importance to the education of the young generation. Overall, I agree with this point.

Surely, there is an assumption that some governors invest athelts and other sports facilities can help the country to get more awards in the worldwide competitions, because better training environments, of nutrition food and experienced coaches are more likely to instruct better athletes and getting into the first tear of the world. This point seems to be reasonable to some extent. However, in spite of this, I am not in favor of this idea for the reason that sometimes, raising the investments of this cannot increase the performance of athelets, excessive luxury life styles may have a negative effect on the fit and speed of sports mans.

Actually, there have been many shining examples that testify to encouraging children to change the nation's sports ability. For example, in Japan, the governments encourage a large number of pupils to take part in the soccer games, which not only instilled a sense of achievement but also find the gifted young people to join the national teams, which offered the substencial sources of expert athletes. Also, is it necessary to emphasize another important fact that giving more priority to the young generation's sports can often mean that it will attract more focus by the publics. Therefore, if the increasing number of persons attach more importance to the sports, citizens' healthy is likely to improve due to more sports daily routing.

In conclusion, from all points elaborated in the previous paragraphs, we can arrive the conclusion that it is wise to investment youth rather than major competitions or professional athletes.
